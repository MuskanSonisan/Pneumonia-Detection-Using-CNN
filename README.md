# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect **pneumonia from chest X-ray images**. The model is trained on publicly available datasets and classifies X-ray images into **Normal** or **Pneumonia** categories.  

This repository is designed to showcase **deep learning and computer vision skills** for placements.
